# Changelog

Joshua v4 has no numbered release yet. This file starts with the state of
`main` on 2026-08-28. From here on, each entry names what changed for the
person who runs Joshua.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Three containers, `channels`, `core`, and `gateway`, from one repository and
  one `docker-compose.yml`. `make up` starts them.
- Channels: Telegram, iMessage through BlueBubbles, a webhook route for
  external events, and the terminal (`make chat`).
- An inbound guard: only the people and groups in `joshua.yaml` get a reply. A
  stranger gets nothing.
- Attachments: files arrive with a timestamped name.
- Memory: notes and a journal per person on one volume, a shared profile, a
  retrieval index, and a nightly reflection that writes the day's post and
  updates each profile.
- On-demand journal posts during a conversation, with a per-person `journal`
  setting (`auto`, `ask`, `off`).
- An optional read-only Memos source for the index.
- Reminders and scheduled tasks.
- A gateway that holds every upstream credential and applies a per-person tool
  policy. The `files` MCP runs inside it.
- `joshua chat`: the terminal is a channel, with an outbox for replies that
  arrive while the person is away.
- The documentation ships into `wiki/joshua/` at each start, so a person
  can ask Joshua how to use it.

### Changed

- Only the container that owns a secret gets it. `joshua.yaml` references the
  channel credentials as `${VAR:-}`, so Compose no longer passes them to
  `core` and `gateway`. `make init-env` sets `.env` to mode 600.

- `make validate` runs in the core image. The host needs Docker and nothing
  else, which matches the quickstart.

- One wiki. `/data/wiki/` is the wiki for everyone who uses Joshua. A member
  writes it, a guest reads it. The per-person `people/<id>/wiki/` is gone; at
  the next start, core moves its pages to `wiki/<id>/`. The documentation
  ships to `wiki/joshua/` instead of `shared/repo-docs/`. `shared/` is
  read-only through the files tool, and the `shared_write` option is gone.

- `joshua.yaml` has no `household` section. `name`, `timezone`, `people`, and
  `groups` are top-level keys.
- The shared profile is `shared/profile.md`.
- The Kubernetes manifests left this repository. The public deployment path is
  Docker Compose.
